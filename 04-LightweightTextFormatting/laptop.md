### Laptops

#### Laptop definition
A [laptop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop) computer or notebook computer, also known as a laptop or notebook, is a small, portable personal computer (PC).

Laptops typically have a clamshell form factor with a flat-panel screen on the inside of the upper lid and an alphanumeric keyboard and pointing device on the inside of the lower lid.

#### Types of laptop
Since the 1970s introduction of portable computers, their forms have changed significantly, resulting in a variety of visually and technologically differing subclasses.

Excepting distinct legal trademark around terms (notably Ultrabook), hard distinctions between these classes were rare, and their usage has varied over time and between sources.

Since the late 2010s, more specific terms have become less commonly used, with sizes distinguished largely by the size of the screen.

#### Laptop hardware
The basic components of laptops function identically to their desktop counterparts.

The design restrictions on power, size, and cooling of laptops limit the maximum performance of laptop parts compared to that of desktop components, although that difference has increasingly narrowed.
