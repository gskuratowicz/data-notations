<p>Since the 1970s introduction of portable computers, their forms have changed significantly, resulting in a variety of visually and technologically differing subclasses.</p>
<p>Excepting distinct legal trademark around terms (notably Ultrabook), hard distinctions between these classes were rare, and their usage has varied over time and between sources.</p>
<p>Since the late 2010s, more specific terms have become less commonly used, with sizes distinguished largely by the size of the screen.</p>
